# IT326-Project-Student-Stress-Factors

## Motivation
Student stress is a growing issue that affects mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. We chose this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to student stress. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover insights that can help develop strategies for managing stress more effectively and improving students' overall health and performance.


## Missing values
In this step, we are detecting the missing values to ensures that the dataset is complete and reliable for analysis, we noticed that our dataset has no missing values.

## Statistical measures
We performed statistical measures analysis on the dataset, including measures of central tendencies and dispersion of data, such as mean, median, mode, midrange, range, quartiles, interquartile range (IQR), variance, and  Standard deviation for all numeric attributes.

## Graph visualization
We used several graphs to explore the distribution, relationships, and variation in stress levels along with five other attributes. Our analysis showed that as stress levels increased, both depression and headache levels rose. Similarly, a box plot of anxiety levels showed a strong positive relationship, with higher stress linked to elevated anxiety. In contrast, living conditions didnâ€™t vary much with stress, though a few individuals experienced extremes. Lastly, we found that higher stress was slightly associated with lower academic performance.

## Outliers
We performed outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method on all numeric attributes in the dataset. For each column, we calculated the IQR as the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), and identified outliers as values falling below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. After detecting the outliers, we removed them to retain a clean dataset with values within the acceptable range.

## Discretization

## Min-Max Normalization
We applied Min-Max normalization to the dataset to scale the numeric features to a range between 0 and 1. This process enhances the performance of machine learning models by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations and prevents features with larger ranges from dominating the model's behavior. During normalization, we excluded the class label (stress_level) because it is the target variable we aim to predict, and including it would distort the scaling process. Additionally, we did not normalize the mental_health_history feature, as it is a binary attribute and normalization would not provide meaningful insights for its interpretation. We focused on the important numeric features while keeping the target variable unchanged, which helps prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

## Feature Selection
We chose the filtering selection method to focus on the most relevant attributes impacting student stress levels, thereby enhancing model performance and interpretability. We calculated the absolute correlation of each feature with the target variable (stress_level) and applied correlation analysis to select features based on their relationships. We set a threshold of 0.7 to identify features that have a strong correlation with the target variable, retaining only those that met this criterion. This selection process involved excluding the target variable itself and compiling a new DataFrame with the relevant features, allowing us to streamline our analysis and effectively identify key factors influencing student stress. If a threshold of 0.7 selected only 10 features ( self_esteem', 'bullying', 'sleep_quality', 'future_career_concerns', 'anxiety_level', 'depression', 'academic_performance', 'headache', 'safety', 'basic_needs') , it indicates that those features have a strong correlation (greater than 0.7) with the target variable (stress_level), suggesting that these features are likely to be the most relevant predictors for stress levels in our dataset.
