## Motivation
Student stress is a growing issue that affects mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. We chose this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to student stress. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover insights that can help develop strategies for managing stress more effectively and improving students' overall health and performance.

## Missing values
In this step, we are detecting the missing values to ensures that the dataset is complete and reliable for analysis, we noticed that our dataset has no missing values.

## Statistical measures
We performed statistical measures analysis on the dataset, including measures of central tendencies and dispersion of data, such as mean, median, mode, midrange, range, quartiles, interquartile range (IQR), variance, and  Standard deviation for all numeric attributes.

## Outliers
We performed outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method on all numeric attributes in the dataset. For each column, we calculated the IQR as the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), and identified outliers as values falling below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. After detecting the outliers, we removed them to retain a clean dataset with values within the acceptable range.
